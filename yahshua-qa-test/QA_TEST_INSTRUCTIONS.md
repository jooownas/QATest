# QA Engineer Assessment — PH Payroll Calculator

## Overview

You are evaluating a Philippine payroll calculator application. Your task is to thoroughly test the application, identify bugs, document them, and write automated tests to catch regressions.

**Time Limit:** 4 hours
**Submission:** Fork this repo, add your findings, open a PR.

---

## Application Under Test

A full-stack payroll calculator that computes:
- Monthly basic salary
- SSS contributions (employer + employee)
- PhilHealth contributions (employer + employee)
- Pag-IBIG / HDMF contributions
- Income tax withholding (TRAIN Law)
- Net pay

---

## Your Tasks

### Task 1: Manual Exploratory Testing (60 min)

Explore the application and document any bugs you find. For each bug:

1. **Title** — Short descriptive name
2. **Severity** — Critical / High / Medium / Low
3. **Steps to Reproduce** — Numbered steps
4. **Expected Result** — What should happen
5. **Actual Result** — What actually happens
6. **Evidence** — Screenshot, API response, console error

### Task 2: API Testing (45 min)

Using Postman, curl, or a tool of your choice:
- Test all API endpoints (`/api/employees/`, `/api/calculate-payroll/`, `/api/payroll-history/`, `/api/tax-brackets/`)
- Test boundary conditions for salary values
- Test with invalid/missing data
- Document any unexpected responses (wrong status codes, wrong data, etc.)

### Task 3: Write Automated Tests (75 min)

Write at least **5 automated tests** using either:
- Cypress (see `e2e-tests/cypress/`)
- Playwright (see `e2e-tests/playwright/`)
- Or pytest for backend API tests

Your tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases.

### Task 4: Bug Report (30 min)

Compile a formal bug report document (`BUG_REPORT.md`) with all findings.

## Hints

- Pay close attention to boundary values in tax calculations.
- Test what happens when you enter unusual or invalid data in forms.
- Check HTTP status codes — they should match REST conventions.
- Verify calculations match the official TRAIN Law tax table above.
